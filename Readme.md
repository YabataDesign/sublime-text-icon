# Sublime Text Icon #

A replacement icon for Sublime Text 2 and 3.

## Installation (Mac OS X) ##

Open the following folder:

    open /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/Resources/

or (Sublime Text 3)

    open /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/Resources/

Replace `Sublime Text 2.icns` or `Sublime Text.icns` with the file "Sublime Text.icns" of this repository.

This won't change the icon on the dock immediately, though.  To change the icon everywhere:

Download "Sublime Text.icns" of this repository.

Navigate to downloads folder, right click on the downloaded file -> copy.

    open /Applications

On the sublime text logo, right click -> get info.

Click the application in the top left corner, Edit -> Paste.

You may have to do the last step again and Edit -> Cut to see the new icon.
